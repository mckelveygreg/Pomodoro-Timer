# Pomodoro-Timer
FreeCodeCamp

It's not pretty, but i'm proud of these features: 
- Play/Pause function: It was hard to preserve the current time, and then begin again at that time
- Reset: it was hard to coordinate stopping/starting/resetting
- Opacity: It makes it a little prettier when each second transitions with a little opacity transition
